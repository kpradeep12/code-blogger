        <title>Using new Switch expressions</title>
        <description>One of the new features released as part of Java 14 is the switch expressions. This feature was available in earlier versions (Java 12 and 13), too, but as a preview. In Java 14, it became standard. The main difference between the existing and new switch is, the new switch is not the only statement but also expression. There are some more differences, which we will learn in this article.</description>

        <title>Create Singleton Instance In Kotlin</title>
        <description>There are many use cases where we need Singleton instances in applications. For example; to maintain a single instance of resources like a database or object store or file system. Kotlin supports singleton instances within the language with object keyword. In this article, we learn using the object keyword to implement singleton instances in Kotlin.</description>

        <title>Cloud Configuration With Micronaut and Consul</title>
        <description>Services may be running on multiple machines/containers, and if each service has its copy of the configuration, then it is a very tedious job to change and restart all instances, in cloud environments we can resolve this issue by publishing configuration at a single location and allowing all services to read it. We learn more about this by developing a sample application using Micronaut and Consul.</description>

        <title>Asyn Method Invocation Design Pattern</title>
        <description>Instead of executing thread and managing its life cycle lets create an Async method invocation pattern which allows us to submit tasks and this pattern manages the threads and when execution completes it passes the result with a callback. This pattern frees up the main thread so it can continue to execute other tasks. This article explains the design and implementation of the Async method invocation design pattern.</description>
