        **FROM** - This will create the base layer for the subsequent instructions  
        *FROM \<image>:\<tag>*{: .small}

        ``` bash
          FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine
        ```
    - term: |
        **WORKDIR** - Set the working directory. RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD instructions will use this while execution. 
        We can have multiple WORKDIR's in a single Dockerfile  
        *WORKDIR /temp*{: .small}
