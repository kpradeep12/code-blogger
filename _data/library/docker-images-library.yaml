        **-d** Runs container in background  
        **\--name** This container will run under the name of 'jenkins'  
        **-p** Jenkins will run on port 8080, so we are mapping to 8085 on the local host  
        **-v** We configured volume because Jenkins will store job information, so next time when we restart, we will see all previous ran jobs in the history
